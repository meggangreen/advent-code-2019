""" Notes

    - Painter is a Computer that paints
        - has its current coords (could track path, but not necessary)
        - registers and tracks panels
        - takes photos for input -- panel's current color
        - outputs (new color, turn direction)
            - paints panel output color
                0 black
                1 white
            - after turning moves forward to next panel
                0 left
                1 right
    - do not reload program

    - Panel is an object
        - has coords (x+yj)
        - has been painted or not
        - has color
        - stored in dict panels {coord: Panel}
