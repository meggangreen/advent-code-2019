        A module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel
        (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative
        fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.
        At first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel
        requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel,
        which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further
        fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of
        mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.
        The fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is:
        33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.
