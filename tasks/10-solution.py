""" Day 10 """

# for one asteroid, i want to know it's line of sight to every other asteroid?
# for one asteroid, i want to follow a line of sight and cancel out blocked asteroids?

# it looks like lots of people used atan2 -- but idk what that is rn so i'm
# looking at a ruby solution that followed my second thought: get the slope of
# the line and cancel out other asteroids with that slope 

# notes from studying a ruby solution (https://github.com/J-Swift/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day_10/part_1/solution.rb)
# - it becomes important to note L and R sides of the asteroid for the slope
# - for the same reason, it's important to note above or below when ast1.x == ast2.x
# - other solutions talk about "floating point math"; is it necessary to keep as fraction (rational in ruby)?

# big thing for me, in particular, to remember is we don't care *which* asteroid
# on the slope we count, just that we count *only one*

# PART 2 NOTES
# - get all unique slopes once
# - vaporize order is clockwise from 12; 
#       ergo slope order is above -> R-largest to R-mallest -> 
#                           below -> L-largest to L-smallest
# x get unique slopes *with* asteroid's distance: slopes = {slope: [diff_x+diff_y*1j]}
# x for each slope in slopes, sort asteroids lists farther-to-closer
#       sorted([asteroids], key=lambda A: abs(A.real)+abs(A.imag), reverse=True)
# x diff ways to fudge slope order
# - vaporized = 0; while vaporized < 200, 
#       for each slope in "ordered" slopes,
#           if slopes[slope]
#           target = slopes[slope].pop())
#           vaporized += 1
